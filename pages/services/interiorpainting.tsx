      <p>
        Doing an interior painting project takes planning, especially if its
        occupied. Depending on the scope of the job, sometimes it's best to work
        in sections, starting and completing portions one at a time. This way
        your entire house isn't a complete "job site" for the duration. A little
        client client/contractor collaboration makes for a seamless job, with
        less inconvenience to the occupants. We make sure to cover all furniture
        and fixtures with plastic and lay heavy drop cloths over the floors. We
        follow all standard preparation and application procedures while
        executing your project, such as sanding, spackling, caulking and
        priming.
