      "I had the best experience with Paintzen. They were easy to communicate with during the quote process. I had two small projects to hang wallpaper on accent walls in two separate rooms and they  gave us a fair quote. They were timely and did a stellar job! I was worried about the installation because the wallpaper prints I chose had complicated patterns, but their attention to detail and making sure the patterns lined up was excellent, it looks seamless!",

      "Easily coordinated, great work. We’d put painting a couple of rooms ‘until’ we had extra time on our hands. That never materialized. So glad I did. 2 rooms done in 6 hours, looks great! Will definitely use the service again.",
